                                    <p dir="ltr">Every year the team at Collabstr analyzes thousands of data points
                                        collected through our <a href="https://collabstr.com" target="_blank"

                                        we list detailed breakdowns of our data and influencer marketing statistics, trends, and
                                        predictions heading into 2023.</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">Despite widespread concerns of a looming recession as we head into 2023,
                                        our team has observed an increase in influencer marketing spend by B2B and B2C companies
                                        which we attribute to a growing reliance on influencers and content creators amongst
                                        brands.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">In last year’s report, we predicted that influencer marketing budgets
                                        would increase due to the iOS 14 update which significantly impacted advertisers on
                                        platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and more. As a result, we’re seeing more
                                        advertisers put an emphasis on the quality of their ad creatives, <a

                                        and 20,000 brands and advertisers which makes it our most data-intensive report so far,
                                        and also one of the largest influencer marketing reports in the industry. The data was

                                    <h2 dir="ltr" id="t1">Influencer Marketing Market Size 2023</h2>
                                    <p dir="ltr">The influencer marketing market size is expected to grow to $17.4 Billion
                                        in 2023. This is a 14.47% increase from 2022 when the influencer marketing market size
                                        was $15.2 Billion.</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">The influencer marketing market shows no sign of slowing down any time
                                        soon either. It’s expected that the market will reach a size of $22.2 Billion in 2025,
                                        which is a 46.05% increase from 2022.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">It’s also possible that the influencer marketing market grows at a quicker
                                        rate than forecasted if external forces push advertisers into spending more on
                                        influencer marketing over the next few years. Some examples of this can already be seen,
                                        such as Apple waging war on social media giants like Meta that rely heavily on data
                                        collection to keep their advertising business afloat. We also see an influx of
                                        influencers hitting the market as platforms like YouTube shorts, Instagram Reels, and
                                        TikTok make it easier than ever for anyone to create content and build an audience.</p>

                                        directly from a corporation. This helps the content fit seamlessly into the feeds of

                                    <p dir="ltr">In the spring of 2021, Apple released an update that allows consumers to
                                        opt-out of data tracking when using apps like Instagram or TikTok. This was a huge hit
                                        to social media companies that rely on this data for their advertising businesses. Apple
                                        has continued to show that they are only going to continue moving in this direction,
                                        which is a big threat to brands that rely solely on advertising to acquire new

                                    <p dir="ltr">Short-video platforms like TikTok are known for their viral aspect. A big
                                        part of the reason these platforms are able to attract so many content creators is the
                                        fact that they offer more organic exposure to content creators than traditional methods,
                                        such as posting photos on Instagram.</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">As a result of this, everybody is becoming a content creator, and with
                                        this, you get more people that become influential in their associated niche.
                                        Micro-influencers can loosely be defined as anyone with a following of less than
                                        50,000.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">With more micro-influencers on the market than ever before, there is more
                                        selection for advertisers and brands that are looking for someone to be the face of

                                        Marketing in 2023</h2>
                                    <p dir="ltr">In 2022, TikTok was the most popular social media platform for influencer
                                        marketing, with 45% of paid collaborations taking place on the platform. Instagram comes
                                        second, with 39% of paid influencer collaborations in 2022 taking place on the
                                        platform.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://collabstr.com/2022-influencer-marketing-report#t3"
                                            target="_blank" rel="noopener">In last year’s report</a>, we observed that
                                        Instagram was still king when it came to influencer marketing, but TikTok was quickly
                                        gaining momentum, and it was expected that it would soon overtake Instagram as the go-to
                                        platform for influencer marketing.</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">We also included user-generated content (UGC) in this year’s breakdown
                                        due to its incredible rate of growth, and that brands are allocating budgets
                                        specifically for UGC, just as they would for a platform like TikTok or Instagram. We
                                        observed that 14% of all paid collaborations were not specific to any particular
                                        platform, but instead they were UGC collaborations where the influencer delivered some
                                        content in exchange for a payment. The number of UGC collaborations in 2022 is higher
                                        than we’ve ever observed in the past.</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">We observed that 2% of paid collaborations took place on YouTube in 2022.
                                        While this may seem low, it’s also important to note that YouTube differs dramatically
                                        from platforms like TikTok and Instagram, where there are much more creators and content
                                        is not as evergreen. YouTube influencers tend to invest more time into the production of
                                        their content, and the content typically stays relevant for much longer, which leads to
                                        higher prices for collaborations.</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">This data was extrapolated from 7,000 paid collaborations between
                                        influencers and advertisers. In order to qualify as a valid data point, we only analyzed
                                        real orders where we could confirm that there was a monetary exchange between the
                                        influencer and the brand. We discarded gifted collaborations, survey data, and any other
                                        collaborations where there was no exchange of money for the service. We believe that
                                        analyzing where the budget is being spent, rather than where people talk about spending
                                        their budget, is the best way to get an accurate look at the landscape.</p>

                                        offer multiple services across multiple platforms, hence the overlap in percentages.</p>

                                        have an Instagram and actively offer paid services on their Instagram account. With
                                        Instagram arguably being the original platform for modern-day influencer marketing, it
                                        makes sense that a majority of influencers offer services on this platform.</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">61% of all influencers offer paid services on TikTok. Last year, we
                                        observed that 38% more influencers were offering services on Instagram over TikTok. This
                                        year, that gap has shrunk to 29% as more influencers make TikTok their primary platform.

                                    <p dir="ltr">User-generated content (UGC) services have exploded in popularity amongst
                                        influencers offering these services. 26% of influencers offer paid UGC services, and due
                                        to the fact that this is not reliant on a social media presence, many of these content
                                        creators don’t offer services on other social media platforms.</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">YouTube comes last, with 9% of influencers offering paid services to
                                        brands on YouTube. It’s much more time-consuming to create content on YouTube than it is
                                        for other platforms. As a result of this, there is a much smaller pool of influencers on
                                        YouTube.</p>

                                    <p dir="ltr">Niches like lifestyle, beauty, and fashion remain popular niches because

                                        This also makes these niches extremely saturated and competitive, which means a small
                                        minority of influencers within these niches make the majority of the money.</p>

                                    <p dir="ltr">Instagram influencers charge $363 on average for a collaboration. This
                                        rate includes content packages where influencers offer static feed posts, reels, and
                                        stories. Prices also fluctuate based on add-ons, such as the utilization of the new <a
                                            href="https://collabstr.com/assets/blog/instagram-collab-post" target="_blank"
                                            rel="noopener">Instagram collab post feature</a>. The average price per content
                                        package is lower on Instagram than it is on TikTok, this could be for a few reasons.</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">First off, there are more influencers on Instagram than on any other
                                        platform, and when there is a surplus of supply, the prices naturally decline.</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">Next, Instagram content takes less time to create than TikTok or YouTube
                                        content. Influencer marketing on Instagram is still heavily reliant on static photo
                                        posts and Instagram stories. On the other hand, TikTok and YouTube are video apps that
                                        do not support photo content, and video can require more time and effort to film and
                                        edit hence the higher price tag.</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">Lastly, Instagram does not offer the organic exposure that other
                                        platforms do. TikTok is known for rewarding creators with millions of views, and YouTube
                                        is an evergreen platform in the sense that it will continue to push your content years
                                        after it has been posted. On the other hand, Instagram has a weak discovery algorithm
                                        which has only recently improved due to the introduction of Reels.</p>
                                    <h3 dir="ltr">User-Generated Content Influencer Cost: $396</h3>
                                    <p dir="ltr">User-generated content (UGC) creators charge $396 on average for a
                                        collaboration. We analyzed thousands of UGC packages from our creators to figure out the
                                        average amount that is charged by them. Some packages may include multiple pieces of
                                        content, while other packages may only include a single piece of content.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">UGC can mean a variety of things such as product photos, ads,
                                        testimonials, unboxing videos, and more. Creators have become increasingly interested in
                                        charging brands for this service as more and more brands are looking for high-quality
                                        custom content for their products.</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">Typically with UGC, usage rights are sold alongside the content package
                                        so that the buyer is granted permission to use the content exclusively, whether that be
                                        on their website, in their ads, or on their own social media channels. This can
                                        contribute to a higher average price per UGC package.</p>
                                    <h3 dir="ltr">TikTok Influencer Cost: $460</h3>
                                    <p dir="ltr">TikTok influencers charge $460 on average for a collaboration. Despite
                                        TikTok being a relatively new platform, influencers seem to be pricing themselves on the
                                        higher end.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">Higher pricing could be due to the fact that TikTok is new, so there
                                        aren’t as many influencers as on Instagram. <a

                                    <p dir="ltr">On average, YouTube influencers make $418 per collaboration. YouTube is
                                        the highest-paying social media platform per brand deal. This is due to the fact that
                                        YouTube content is labor-intensive to produce, and it also stays relevant for a much
                                        longer time than content on platforms like TikTok or Instagram.</p>

                                        niche as it is predominantly filled with influencers that also identify as celebrities
                                        of some sort. When an influencer stars in a movie or becomes a popular music artist, it
                                        becomes more expensive to pay them for their personal brand.</p>

                                        the most profitable niches for Adsense income on YouTube is the investment and personal

                                    <p dir="ltr">After analyzing 50,000 influencer profiles we found that 77% of
                                        influencers are female, and 23% of influencers are male.</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">Influencer marketing is still heavily dominated by females, and this data
                                        is consistent with our findings in last year's report as well. If we look at the
                                        previous statistic of the top 10 most popular influencer niches, the top three niches
                                        (lifestyle, beauty, fashion) are female-dominated niches.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p dir="ltr">When breaking down the gender distribution of influencers by platform, we
                                        can see that not every platform has the same imbalance of females and males.</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">The platform with the largest gap between male and female influencers is
                                        Instagram, where 79% of influencers are female and 21% of influencers are male.&nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">TikTok comes next on the list where 76% of influencers are female, and
                                        24% of influencers are male. While still a large gap, genders are more balanced than on
                                        Instagram, presumably because video content opens up the doors to different content
                                        styles that may not exist on Instagram. For example, the comedy and entertainment niche
                                        is one of the most popular niches on TikTok, and 48% of influencers in this niche are
                                        male, while the other 52% are female. This is a prime example of how the birth of new
                                        platforms and content mediums can offset imbalances and encourage more people to create
                                        content.</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">YouTube is the platform with the smallest gap between the number of
                                        female and male influencers. 69% of influencers on YouTube are female, while 31% are
                                        male. YouTube is a high barrier-to-entry platform that ultimately weeds out people that
                                        might be looking for quick success.</p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">We also wanted to include the gender breakdown of user-generated content
                                        influencers and content creators. We found that 82% of creators offering user-generated
                                        content services are female, and only 18% are male. Typically these creators are hired
                                        for the creation of <a href="https://collabstr.com/assets/blog/ugc-ads" target="_blank"

                                        seems that female UGC creators are favored by the market and typically win most of the
                                        opportunities, but this could also be due to a lack of male supply.</p>

                                        start to finish. Some collaborations can be longer or shorter than 16 days depending on

                                        hours are most likely to follow through with the collaboration and ultimately get paid
                                        for doing the work. This number has been shrinking year over year, as influencers begin
                                        to treat brand collaborations as legitimate business opportunities.</p>

                                        with the advertiser begins to decline. One of the main reasons for this is that brands
                                        are typically on tight deadlines and as a result, they initiate communication with
